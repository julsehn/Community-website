# Installing and Updating Drivers

In this guide, you will learn how to download or update drivers on your computer.

::: warning
It is highly recommended to avoid using third-party software to update or install your drivers.
:::

## Identifying Your Hardware

The first step in installing drivers is to correctly identify the hardware you need drivers for. This information can be found in your computer's manual or by using the Device Manager. You can access the device manager by right clicking the Windows start button or by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> and selecting Device Manager. In the Device Manager, look for the device you need drivers for, and expand its entry to see its model number.

You can also use the System Information tool to find hardware information; open System Information, navigate to the ‚ÄúHardware‚Äù section and find the device for which you require drivers.

## Method 1: Using Windows Update

You can usually find drivers for your devices in Windows Update, instead of having to manually download the file.

1. Open Settings via the start menu or by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>.

2. Go to Update & Security (on Windows 10) or Windows Update (on Windows 11).

3. Click on ‚ÄúCheck for Updates‚Äù or "Download & Install Updates".

Windows Update might say that you are up-to-date, even if optional updates are available. You can check for more optional updates in the 'Optional updates' section of Windows Update settings.

### On Windows 11:

1. Click "Advanced options".

2. Click "Optional updates".

   ![The Advanced options menu, with the Optional updates button highlighted.](./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-advanced-options-optional-updates.png)

3. Click "Driver updates" to show the list of available driver updates if there are any.

   ![The Optional updates menu, with the Driver updates menu highlighted.](./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-optional-updates-driver-updates.png)

4. Select any optional updates you wish to install, then click "Download & install".

   ![An available optional driver update, with the Download & install button selected.](./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/optional-updates/windows-update-driver-update-example.png)

### On Windows 10:

1. Open the Settings app. You can do this by searching for it in the Start menu, pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>, or pressing the Settings icon above the power button.

   ![The Settings button in Windows 10's Start menu.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/opensettings.png)

2. Select "Update & Security".

   ![The "Update & Security" tile in Windows 10's Settings app.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/updateandsecurity.png)

3. If there are updates available, click "Download". Otherwise, click "Check for Updates".

## Method 2: Using your OEM's website

::: tip Note
"OEM" here refers to the manufacturer of an entire device, like a laptop or pre-built desktop. If you are using a custom-built computer, you should follow [Method 3](#method-3-using-your-manufacturer-s-website) instead.
:::

It is highly recommended to download or update your drivers through your manufacturer's website, as that will guarantee proper functionality, provided you've installed the correct drivers. This is especially a good idea for your Graphics Card (GPU) Drivers.

All you need to do is:

1. On the search engine of your choice (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc‚Ä¶), search for "{device manufacturer} drivers".
2. Visit the manufacturer's website and enter the model of your device, then follow the instructions on the page.
3. When you select the product, you may be shown with 2 options:

- Download the driver downloader (recommended).
- Download this specific driver only and install it manually.

### Well-known manufacturers' websites

- [Dell](https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-us?app=drivers)

- [HP](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers)

- [Lenovo](https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en)

- [ASUS](https://www.asus.com/support/download-center)

- [Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)

- [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)

- [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)

::: tip Note
You may also want to use Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU) for this if you're using an NVIDIA or Intel GPU. If that's the case, there is an excellent guide on that [here](https://www.wagnardsoft.com/content/ddu-guide-tutorial). If you're using an AMD GPU, then the Radeon installer's built-in "factory reset" (under Additional Options) function is preferred over DDU.

## Method 3: Using your manufacturer's website

::: tip Note
"Manufacturer" here refers to the manufacturer of an individual piece of hardware. If you are using a laptop or a pre-built desktop, you should probably download drivers from your OEM's website instead. See [Method 2](#method-2-using-your-oem-s-website).
:::

For each piece of hardware in your computer that you wish to get drivers for:

1. On the search engine of your choice (Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc‚Ä¶), search for "{hardware manufacturer} drivers".

2. Search for the model number of the piece of hardware you want to upgrade/install drivers for.

3. When you select the product, you may have two options:

    - Download the driver downloader (recommended).
    - Download this specific driver only and install it manually.

## Method 4: Device Manager

::: warning Warning
This method may not work effectively on older versions of Windows, if this is the case then don't follow this method.
:::

1. Open Device Manager by either searching for it in Start or pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> and tapping <kbd>M</kbd> afterwards.

   ![Windows 10's taskbar search menu, with "Device Manager" shown as the first result.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/devmgmtsearch.png)

2. Find the category of your device (for example, "Display adapters"). You'll be presented with a list of devices installed in your system.

   ![Device Manager's "Display adapters" section is expanded. Underneath it, Device Manager shows any connected graphics devices. This image shows an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER in the "Display adapters" section.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/devmgmtdisplayadapt.png)

3. Right-click the device you wish to reinstall. Then, select "Uninstall device".

   ![The "Uninstall device" option is in the context menu that appears when right-clicking a device in Device Manager.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/devmgmtuninstall.png)

4. Select "Delete the driver software for this device" then click "Uninstall". Note that your screen may flicker after clicking this button.

   ![Device Manager shows a confirmation window before uninstalling the driver for the device. The checkbox for "Delete the driver software for this device" is checked.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/devmgmtdelete.png)

5. Go to "Action", then select "Scan for hardware changes".

   !["Scan for hardware changes" is shown under Device Manager's "Action" menu, at the top of the window.](./img/reinstalling-gpu-drivers/devmgmtscan.png)

6. Go back to the unrecognised devices category or go to the same device category and find the target you are trying to reinstall. If you find it in unrecognised devices, right-click and install it. Or if it's already reinstalled automatically, you're done. (In GPU, note that it may now be called "Microsoft Basic Display Adapter". Right-click it and select "Update driver").

      ![The prompt to restart your computer, shown after rolling back a driver.](./img/installing-and-updating-drivers/troubleshooting/hardware-change-restart-prompt.png)

3. Alternate method (Safe Mode with Command Prompt)

   If you can't access the normal safe mode, you may try to access Safe Mode with Command Prompt and execute the following commands in Command Prompt (replace `not_working_driver` with the driver that isn't working):

   ```text
   DISM /Image:C:\ /Get-Drivers
   DISM /Image:C:\ /Remove-Driver /Driver:not_working_driver.inf
   ```

   You should see something like this:  

   ```text
   Found 1 driver package(s) to remove.
   Removing 1 of 1 ‚Äì not_working_driver.inf: The driver package was successfully removed.
   The operation completed successfully.
   ```
